abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective.What distin- guishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the al- gorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book,we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.},

abstract = {We propose a novel recursive partitioning method for identifying subgroups of subjects with enhanced treatment effects based on a differential effect search algorithm. The idea is to build a collection of subgroups by recursively partitioning a database into two subgroups at each parent group, such that the treatment effect within one of the two subgroups is maximized compared with the other subgroup. The process of data splitting continues until a predefined stopping condition has been satisfied. The method is similar to 'interaction tree' approaches that allow incorporation of a treatment-by-split interaction in the splitting criterion. However, unlike other tree-based methods, this method searches only within specific regions of the covariate space and generates multiple subgroups of potential interest. We develop this method and provide guidance on key topics of interest that include generating multiple promising subgroups using different splitting criteria, choosing optimal values of complexity parameters via cross-validation, and addressing Type I error rate inflation inherent in data mining applications using a resampling-based method. We evaluate the operating characteristics of the procedure using a simulation study and illustrate the method with a clinical trial example.

We propose a simple method for modeling interactions between the treatment and covariates. The idea is to modify the covariate in a simple way, and then fit a standard model using the modified covariates and no main effects. We show that coupled with an efficiency augmentation procedure, this method produces clinically meaningful estimators in a variety of settings. It can be useful for practicing personalized medicine: determining from a large set of biomarkers the subset of patients that can potentially benefit from a treatment. We apply the method to both simulated datasets and real trial data. The modified covariates idea can be used for other purposes, for example, large scale hypothesis testing for determining which of a set of covariates interact with a treatment variable.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of identifying a subgroup of patients who may have an enhanced treatment effect in a randomized clinical trial, and it is desirable that the subgroup be defined by a limited number of covariates. For this problem, the development of a standard, pre-determined strategy may help to avoid the well-known dangers of subgroup analysis. We present a method developed to find subgroups of enhanced treatment effect. This method, referred to as 'Virtual Twins', involves predicting response probabilities for treatment and control 'twins' for each subject. The difference in these probabilities is then used as the outcome in a classification or regression tree, which can potentially include any set of the covariates. We define a measure Q({\^{A}}) to be the difference between the treatment effect in estimated subgroup {\^{A}} and the marginal treatment effect. We present several methods developed to obtain an estimate of Q({\^{A}}), including estimation of Q({\^{A}}) using estimated probabilities in the original data, using estimated probabilities in newly simulated data, two cross-validation-based approaches, and a bootstrap-based bias-corrected approach. Results of a simulation study indicate that the Virtual Twins method noticeably outperforms logistic regression with forward selection when a true subgroup of enhanced treatment effect exists. Generally, large sample sizes or strong enhanced treatment effects are needed for subgroup estimation. As an illustration, we apply the proposed methods to data from a randomized clinical trial.},

These regimes are particularly useful for managing chronic disorders, and fit well into the larger paradigm of personalized medicine. They provide one way to operationalize a clinical decision support system. Statistics plays a key role in the construction of evidence-based dynamic treatment regimes - informing best study design as well as efficient estimation and valid inference. Due to the many novel methodological challenges it offers, this area has been growing in popularity among statisticians in recent years. In this article, we review the key developments in this exciting field of research. In particular, we discuss the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs, estimation techniques like Q-learning and marginal structural models, and several inference techniques designed to address the associated non-standard asymptotics. We reference software, whenever available. We also outline some important future directions.},

abstract = {When comparing a new treatment with a control in a randomized clinical study, the treatment effect is generally assessed by evaluating a summary measure over a specific study population. The success of the trial heavily depends on the choice of such a population. In this paper, we show a systematic, effective way to identify a promising population, for which the new treatment is expected to have a desired benefit, utilizing the data from a current study involving similar comparator treatments. Specifically, using the existing data, we first create a parametric scoring system as a function of multiple multiple baseline covariates to estimate subject-specific treatment differences. Based on this scoring system, we specify a desired level of treatment difference and obtain a subgroup of patients, defined as those whose estimated scores exceed this threshold. An empirically calibrated threshold-specific treatment difference curve across a range of score values is constructed. The subpopulation of patients satisfying any given level of treatment benefit can then be identified accordingly. To avoid bias due to overoptimism, we utilize a cross-training-evaluation method for implementing the above two-step procedure. We then show how to select the best scoring system among all competing models. Furthermore, for cases in which only a single pre-specified working model is involved, inference procedures are proposed for the average treatment difference over a range of score values using the entire data set, and are justified theoretically and numerically. Lastly, the proposals are illustrated with the data from two clinical trials in treating HIV and cardiovascular diseases. Note that if we are not interested in designing a new study for comparing similar treatments, the new procedure can also be quite useful for the management of future patients, so that treatment may be targeted towards those who would receive nontrivial benefits to compensate for the risk or cost of the new treatment.},

Its goal is to determine the heterogeneity of the treatment effect across subpopulations. In this paper, we adapt the idea of recursive partitioning and introduce an interaction tree (IT) procedure to conduct subgroup analysis. The IT procedure automatically facilitates a number of objectively defined subgroups, in some of which the treatment effect is found prominent while in others the treatment has a negligible or even negative effect. The standard CART (Breiman et al., 1984) methodology is inherited to construct the tree structure. Also, in order to extract factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of the treatment effect, variable importance measure is made available via random forests of the interaction trees. Both simulated experiments and analysis of census wage data are presented for illustration.},

In this report we evaluate the short screening scale in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a population‐based survey of US household and group quarter residents. DSM‐IV PTSD was assessed via symptom questions in the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule‐DSM‐IV (AUDADIS‐IV) version. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and percent correctly classified were calculated, using the interview‐based diagnosis as the standard. Replicating findings from the initial report, a score of four or more on the short screening scale identifies cases of PTSD with sensitivity of 78{\%}, specificity of 97{\%}, positive predictive value of 75{\%}, and negative predictive value of 98{\%}. The percentage of correctly classified respondents was 96{\%}. The findings support the utility of the seven‐item scale for screening PTSD in clinical and general population samples.},

abstract = {Up to one fourth of women diagnosed with early breast cancer (EBC) have tumors that are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive. This is associated with a high risk of relapse and death from meta-static disease. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of HER-2, improves survival and quality of life in women with HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Four major adjuvant trials-Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA), National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-31, North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831, and Breast Cancer International Research Group (BCIRG) 006-including between them {\textgreater}13,000 women with HER-2-positive EBC, have investigated different adjuvant treatment approaches with trastuzumab. These trials have shown that trastuzumab reduces the 3-year risk of recurrence by about half in this population. The benefit was similar across the trials despite differences in patient populations, chemotherapy regimens, and sequencing of treatment. At a 2-year follow-up, interim results from the combined analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 trials showed a one third lower mortality for trastuzumab, and there was a trend toward an overall survival benefit in the HERA and BCIRG trials. A small Finnish trial, FinHer, investigating another regimen of trastuzumab, has also shown similarly positive results. Further follow-up of the major adjuvant trials will clarify the survival benefit for women receiving trastuzumab, as well as the optimal treatment duration (1 or 2 years). Notably, cardiac events in the trastuzumab-containing arms of these trials have remained within acceptable levels, with a slightly higher (0.6{\%}-3.3{\%}) incidence of congestive heart failure that mostly responded to treatment. Further follow-up will provide information on long-term cardiac safety. Overall, results from clinical trials are sufficiently compelling to consider 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment for women with HER-2-positive EBC based on the risk:benefit ratio demonstrated in these studies.},

SETTING: Two large general hospitals in Merseyside, England. PARTICIPANTS: 18 820 patients aged {\textgreater} 16 years admitted over six months and assessed for cause of admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of admissions due to an ADR, length of stay, avoidability, and outcome. RESULTS: There were 1225 admissions related to an ADR, giving a prevalence of 6.5{\%}, with the ADR directly leading to the admission in 80{\%} of cases. The median bed stay was eight days, accounting for 4{\%} of the hospital bed capacity. The projected annual cost of such admissions to the NHS is 466m pounds sterling (706m Euros, 847m dollars). The overall fatality was 0.15{\%}. Most reactions were either definitely or possibly avoidable. Drugs most commonly implicated in causing these admissions included low dose aspirin, diuretics, warfarin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than aspirin, the most common reaction being gastrointestinal bleeding. CONCLUSION: The burden of ADRs on the NHS is high, accounting for considerable morbidity, mortality, and extra costs. Although many of the implicated drugs have proved benefit, measures need to be put into place to reduce the burden of ADRs and thereby further improve the benefit:harm ratio of the drugs.},

The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show that ranger is the fastest and most memory efficient implementation of random forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.},

abstract = {Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) is a simple way for agents to learn how to act optimally in controlled Markovian domains. It amounts to an incremental method for dynamic programming which imposes limited computational demands. It works by successively improving its evaluations of the quality of particular actions at particular states. This paper presents and proves in detail a convergence theorem forQ-learning based on that outlined in Watkins (1989). We show thatQ-learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely. We also sketch extensions to the cases of non-discounted, but absorbing, Markov environments, and where manyQ values can be changed each iteration, rather than just one.},

@article{Zhao2013a,
abstract = {When comparing a new treatment with a control in a randomized clinical study, the treatment effect is generally assessed by evaluating a summary measure over a specific study population. The success of the trial heavily depends on the choice of such a population. In this paper, we show a systematic, effective way to identify a promising population, for which the new treatment is expected to have a desired benefit, utilizing the data from a current study involving similar comparator treatments. Specifically, using the existing data, we first create a parametric scoring system as a function of multiple multiple baseline covariates to estimate subject-specific treatment differences. Based on this scoring system, we specify a desired level of treatment difference and obtain a subgroup of patients, defined as those whose estimated scores exceed this threshold. An empirically calibrated threshold-specific treatment difference curve across a range of score values is constructed. The subpopulation of patients satisfying any given level of treatment benefit can then be identified accordingly. To avoid bias due to overoptimism, we utilize a cross-training-evaluation method for implementing the above two-step procedure. We then show how to select the best scoring system among all competing models. Furthermore, for cases in which only a single pre-specified working model is involved, inference procedures are proposed for the average treatment difference over a range of score values using the entire data set, and are justified theoretically and numerically. Lastly, the proposals are illustrated with the data from two clinical trials in treating HIV and cardiovascular diseases. Note that if we are not interested in designing a new study for comparing similar treatments, the new procedure can also be quite useful for the management of future patients, so that treatment may be targeted towards those who would receive nontrivial benefits to compensate for the risk or cost of the new treatment.},

@article{Qian2011,
abstract = {Because many illnesses show heterogeneous response to treatment, there is increasing interest in individualizing treatment to patients [11]. An individualized treatment rule is a decision rule that recommends treatment according to patient characteristics. We consider the use of clinical trial data in the construction of an individualized treatment rule leading to highest mean response. This is a difficult computational problem because the objective function is the expectation of a weighted indicator function that is non-concave in the parameters. Furthermore there are frequently many pretreatment variables that may or may not be useful in constructing an optimal individualized treatment rule yet cost and interpretability considerations imply that only a few variables should be used by the individualized treatment rule. To address these challenges we consider estimation based on l1 penalized least squares. This approach is justified via a finite sample upper bound on the difference between the mean response due to the estimated individualized treatment rule and the mean response due to the optimal individualized treatment rule.},

Randomized Clinical Trials$\backslash$n(RCT) often go without clear a priori hypotheses on the subgroups$\backslash$ninvolved in treatment-subgroup interactions, and with a large number of$\backslash$npre-treatment characteristics in the data.

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre-lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna-tional conference, * * * , 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},
