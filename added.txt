What is supervised learning?

learning from a set of descriptions of situations and the correct action to take in those situations (training set), goal is to generalize to new situations

(S&B p2 c1)

\ 
What's a major limitation of supervised learning?

It may be impractical to obtain examples of correct behavior in every situation the learner may encounter.

\ 
How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning?

No training set need be provided. 

(S&B p2 c1)

\ 
What is unsupervised learning?

typically about finding structure hidden in collections of data where correct action is unknown

(S&B p2 c1)

\
How does reinforcement learning differ from unsupervised learning?

While reinforcement learning does not rely on examples of correct behavior, reinforcement learning is trying to maximize a reward signal instead of trying to find hidden structure. (though hidden structure may be valuable to that end)

(S&B p2 c1)

\
What is the relationship between Clinical Reinforcement trials and SMARTs?

When the set of treatments is finite, a clinical reinforcement trial reduces to a SMART design.
