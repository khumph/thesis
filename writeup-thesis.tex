\subsection{Virtual Patient Model} % (fold)
\label{sub:vpm}

I began by simulating 1000 patients, each receiving six months of treatment. Each patient had a random starting tumor mass and patient health, both generated from uniform distributions between 0 and 2. The initial treatment dose was selected from a uniform distribution between 0.5 and 1 (so that everyone entered the trial receiving some treatment). Subsequent doses were selected from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 at the beginning of each month.

Patient health change was modelled as a function of tumor mass and dosage of treatment, with doses above 0.5 decreasing health and doses below 0.5 allowing health to increase due to less toxic effects from the treatment.

\[
\dot{H}_{t} = - 0.1 M_{t-1} - 1.2 (D_{t-1} - 0.5)
\]

Where $\dot{H}_{t}$ is the change in patient health from month $t-1$ to month $t$, 
$M_{t-1}$ is the tumor mass the previous month, and 
$D_{t-1}$ is the dose of treatment for the previous month

Tumor mass change was modelled as a function of patient health and dosage, with doses above 0.5 decreasing tumor mass and doses below 0.5 allowing it to increase:

\[
\dot{M}_{t} = [- 0.15 H_{t-1} - 1.2 (D_{t-1} - 0.5)] I_{\{M_{t-1} > 0\}}(M_{t-1})
\]

Where $\dot{M}_{t}$ is the change in tumor mass from one month to another,
$H_{t-1}$ is the health from the previous month,
$M_{t-1}$ is the tumor mass the previous month,
$D_{t-1}$ is the dose for the previous month,
$I_{\{M_{t-1} > 0\}}(M)$ indicates that if a person is cured (previous tumor mass = 0), then tumors do not recur.

\label{sub:}

The reward was defined as the sum of three parts: 

\[
R_{t} = R_{t, 1} + R_{t, 2} + R_{t, 3}
\]

First, a large negative reward of -60 was given if the patient died, since a primary endpoint is typically overall survival:

\[
R_{t, 1}(M_{t-1}, H_{t-1}, D_{t-1}) = 
\begin{cases}
  -60 & \text{patient died} \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Second, a small negative reward of -5 was given for an decrease in patient health above 0.5 and a small positive reward of 5 if patient health increased by more than 0.5:

\[
R_{t, 2}(M_{t-1}, H_{t-1}, D_{t-1}) =  
\begin{cases}
  5 & \dot{H} > 0.5 \\
  0 & -0.5 \leq \dot{H} \leq 0.5 \\
  -5 & \dot{H} < -0.5
\end{cases}
\]

Third, similar to the rewards for toxicity, a small negative reward of -5 was given for an increase in tumor mass above 0.5, no reward if the tumor mass did not increase or decrease by more than 0.5, a small positive reward of 5 if the tumor mass decreased by more than 0.5, and a moderate positive reward of 15 was given if the patient was cured (the resulting tumor mass was less than or equal to zero):

\[
R_{t, 3}(M_{t-1}, H_{t-1}, D_{t-1}) = 
\begin{cases}
  -5 & \dot{M} > 0.5 \\
  0 & -0.5 \leq \dot{M} \leq 0.5 \\
  5 & \dot{M} < -0.5 \\
  15 & \dot{M} + M \leq 0
\end{cases}
\]
